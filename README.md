The Weather Dashboard project is a JavaScript and API focused project requiring the use of API calls, object arrays, functions, loops, and local storage. I used the Openweathermap.org API to pull weather data and generate a dynamic application that displays the current weather and a 5-day forecast. The reported UV index updates color based on the severity. Previous city searches are saved in local storage and clicking on the previous search buttons that get generated will re-run the application to pull the most up to date weather data for the selected location. If the user reloads the page, then any existing previous searches will reamin in local storage and the information displayed will clear out, making the app ready for a new search.
